# Lobby
## Overview






The **Lobby Service** works together with custom **Room Servers** to provide multi-user experiences (i.e. online games, shared streaming, etc.) to groups of participants.

It is available to apps that have **<%= data.branding.productNameRTT %>** enabled.

:::info
You configure <em>Lobby Types</em> in the portal under <strong>Design | Multiplayer | Lobbies</strong>.

### Key concepts

![Online Multiplayer Process](@site/docs/img/api-img/online_multiplayer_process.png)

*Lobbies* are used to gather up users prior to launching shared experiences via *Room Servers*. Users can be added to teams, indicate their ready status, and adjust personal and room settings before the experience starts.

The *Lobby Service* also offers highly configurable *Online Matchmaking* - to quickly and efficiently pair users up together.

*For more information on Lobby Concepts, see the [Lobby Overview](/learn/key-concepts/multiplayer/lobbies/) page.*

The Lobby Service provides APIs for *Online Matchmaking*, *Lobby Experience* and *Room Server Integration*.

### Online Matchmaking

The *Online Matchmaking* APIs allow users to find and/or create lobbies:

* [FindLobby](/api/capi/lobby/findlobby) - Find a lobby to meet the provided specs.
* [CreateLobby](/api/capi/lobby/createlobby) - Create a lobby.
* [FindOrCreateLobby](/api/capi/lobby/findorcreatelobby) - Search for lobby; create one if nothing suitable is found.
* [JoinLobby](/api/capi/lobby/joinlobby) - Adds the caller to the given lobby instance.

* [GetRegionsForLobbies](/api/capi/lobby/getregionsforlobbies) - Retrieves the region settings for each of the given lobby types.
* [PingRegions](/api/capi/lobby/pingregions) - Retrieves associated PingData averages to be used with all associated WithPingData APIs.

* [FindLobbyWithPingData](/api/capi/lobby/findlobbywithpingdata) - Adds the caller to the lobby entry queue.
* [FindOrCreateLobbyPingData](/api/capi/lobby/createlobbywithpingdata) - Creates an instance of a lobby.
* [FindOrCreateLobbyWithPingData](/api/capi/lobby/findorcreatelobbywithpingdata) - Adds the caller to the lobby entry queue and will create a lobby if none are found.
* [JoinLobbyWithPingData](/api/capi/lobby/joinlobbywithpingdata) - Adds the caller to the given lobby instance.

### Lobby Experience

The following APIs allow users to interact with lobby's once they have joined:

* [GetLobbyData](/api/capi/lobby/getlobbydata) - request info about the lobby
* [UpdateReady](/api/capi/lobby/updateready) - update the user's ready-status
* [UpdateSettings](/api/capi/lobby/updatesettings) - update the lobby's setting data (owner only)
* [SwitchTeam](/api/capi/lobby/switchteam) - switch teams
* [SendSignal](/api/capi/lobby/sendsignal) - send an event to all other lobby members
* [LeaveLobby](/api/capi/lobby/leavelobby) - leave the lobby
* [RemoveMember](/api/capi/lobby/removemember) - kicks another member from the lobby

### Room Service Integration

The following APIs are called by Room Service providers:

* [SysRoomReady](/api/capi/lobby/sysroomready) - the room experience is ready to launch
* [SysRoomCancelled](/api/capi/lobby/sysroomcancelled) - the room server request cannot be fulfilled

### Lobby Events

These APIs can result in the following events being sent to lobby members.


| Event | Data | Description |
|-------|------| -------|
| MATCHMAKING_IN_PROGRESS | lobbyType, step, maxSteps, minRating, maxRating, lobbiesInRange | Start provisioning lobby. Sent to everyone as they are being processed for each marchmaking round. |
| MEMBER_JOIN | lobbyId, currentTime, lobby, memeber | A new member has joined the lobby. Sent to everyone, including the user who joined. |
| JOIN_FAIL | lobbyType, reason | Could not locate a lobby that satisfies the filter criteria in the specified timeframe. The returned `reason` is mapped with `code` (including `NO_LOBBIES_FOUND`, `FIND_REQUEST_CANCELLED`) and `desc`. |
| MEMBER_LEFT | lobbyId, lobby, member, reason | A member has left the lobby. Sent to everyone, including the user who left. The returned `reason` is mapped with `code` (including `LEFT_BY_CHOICE`, `EVICTED`, `LOST_CONNECTION`) and `desc`. |
| MEMBER_UPDATE | lobbyId, lobby,  member | A member has updated their data, which may include switching teams, thus why all of lobbyData is returned. |
| SIGNAL | lobbyId, from (optional), signalData | This message allows players in lobbies to send messages to all other players. |
| SETTINGS_UPDATE | lobbyId, currentTime, lobby | Changes to the settings that will be used to start the room. |
| STATUS_UPDATE | lobbyId, lobby | The status of the overall lobby has changed. |
| STARTING | lobbyId, lobby | This message is sent once all the hosted server launch conditions have been met and a server instance is being started. |
| ROOM_ASSIGNED | lobbyId, connectData, passcode | A room has been allocated for this lobby. `connectData` is likely incompolete. Each lobby member receives a random alphanumeric passcode for use in connecting to the room server to guard against impersonation. |
| ROOM_READY | lobbyId, connectData, passcode | Go connect to the specified room. Will normally be immediately followed by DISBANDED. The same passcode as sent in ROOM_ASSIGNED will be repeated here as well.  |
| DISBANDED | lobbyId, reason, msg (optional)| The lobby has been terminated. The returned `reason` is mapped with `code` (including `TIMEOUT`, `ROOM_READY`, `ROOM_READY_TIMEOUT`, `ROOM_CANCELLED`, `ERROR_ASSIGNING_ROOM`, `ERROR_LAUNCHING_ROOM`, `HOSTING_NOT_ENABLED`, `SERVER_MAX_REACHED`, `BY_REQUEST`) and `desc`. |

An example of using the returned `reason code` of DISBANDED:

```
if (result.data.reason.code != this.bc.reasonCodes.RTT_ROOM_READY)
{
    // Disbanded for any other reason than ROOM_READY, means we failed to launch the game.
    this.onGameScreenClose()
}
```


### Common Event Structures

The following structures are common to multiple event types:

### `lobbyTypeDef`

The configured meta-data for the lobby type:

```
{
    lobbyTypeDef: {
        "roomConfig": null,
        "lobbyTypeId": "unranked",
        "teams": {
            "player1": {
                "minUsers": 1,
                "maxUsers": 1,
                "autoAssign": true,
                "code": "player1"
            },
            "player2": {
                "minUsers": 1,
                "maxUsers": 1,
                "autoAssign": true,
                "code": "player2"
            }
        },
        "rules": {
            "allowEarlyStartWithoutMax": false,
            "forceOnTimeStartWithoutReady": true,
            "onTimeStartSecs": 90,
            "everyReadyMinPercent": 100,
            "everyReadyMinNum": 2,
            "earliestStartSecs": 0,
            "tooLateSecs": 180
        },
        "desc": "Unranked match"
    }
}
```

### `members`

The list of members in the lobby, and their status:

```
{
    "members": [
        {
            "profileId": "f6fa3e0e-6aac-497a-84e1-c8db6f545c12",
            "name": "david",
            "pic": "",
            "rating": 0,
            "team": "player2",
            "isReady": true,
            "extra": {},
            "cxId": "22819:f6fa3e0e-6aac-497a-84e1-c8db6f545c12:vn0vnr7li5ll6t7gc0om18hksg"
        },
        {
            "profileId": "1dab1250-facb-419a-80cf-3d2de4e91e0b",
            "name": "david2",
            "pic": "",
            "rating": 0,
            "team": "player1",
            "isReady": true,
            "extra": {},
            "cxId": "22819:1dab1250-facb-419a-80cf-3d2de4e91e0b:bkr44a0ssbd0q3ae3r2i2refjh"
        }
    ]
}
```

### `settings`

The developer-defined, dynamic settings for this lobby instance:

```
{
    "settings": {
        "gameTime": 300,
        "isPlaying": 0,
        "mapLayout": 0,
        "mapSize": 1,
        "gameName": "ste123's Room",
        "maxPlayers": 8,
        "lightPosition": 0,
        "minLevel": 0,
        "maxLevel": 50
    }
}
```

*The json above is just an example - it can be whatever the developer decides.*



### Search Algorithms

When looking for a lobby.

### `ranged-percent`

Ranges provided are interpreted as percentages to be applied to the user's rating for matchmaking.

```
{
   "rating" : 1200,
   "algo":{  
      "strategy":"ranged-percent",
      "alignment":"center",
      "ranges":[  
         10,
         20,
         80
      ]
   }
}
```

### `ranged-absolute`

Ranges provided are interpreted as absolute values to add/subtract from the user's rating when calculating the range for matchmaking

```
{ 
   "rating" : 76, 
   "algo":{  
      "strategy":"ranged-absolute",
      "alignment":"center",
      "ranges":[  
         5,
         7.5,
         10
      ]
   }
}
```

### `alignment`

Alignment | Min | Max | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
high | 80 | 100 | Ensures that lobbies must have skill rating >= to the candidate. Leaves the min equal to player rating, and adds 200% of the range to the max.
mid-high | 75 | 95 | Subtracks 50% of the range for the min, and adds 150% of the range to the max.
center | 70 | 90 | Centers the range around the candidiate's rating.
mid-low | 65 | 85 | Subtracts 150% of the range for the min, and adds 50% of the range to the max.
low | 60 | 80 | Ensures that lobbies will have skill rating <= to the candidate.  Subtracts 200% of the range from the rating to calculate min, and leaves max as the player rating.

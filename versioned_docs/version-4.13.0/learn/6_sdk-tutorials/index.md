Welcome to the brainCloud SDK tutorials.

brainCloud is a big system, with a very comprehensive set of features, APIs and tools.  These tutorials aim to de-mystify the system and get you up-and-running as quickly as possible.

And yeah, we are aware that these tutorials (and the docs themselves) don't yet have the full coverage that they should.  We realize and are working hard to address that. If you're confused or can't find some information, please reach out via the chat button in the portal - we'll answer any questions immediately, and work to quickly address the documentation issue as well!

We're committed to aggressively adding and improving our tutorial library (and our documentation in general) as we grow the system - thanks for bearing with us!

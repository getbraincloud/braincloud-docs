**Acey Deucey**, the brainCloud JavaScript example game, helps you get acquainted with using the brainCloud JavaScript client library. The card game is fairly simple - players bet on whether the next card flipped will be between two faceup cards. The game result is calculated as follows:

- Win - if your card is between the two faceup cards
- Lose - if your card is outside the range of the two faceup cards
- Lose twice your bet - if your card is the same as either of the two faceup cards (hitting the post)

Further information about the card game can be found on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acey_Deucey_%28card_game%29).

The example game shows off the following brainCloud features:

- Email authentication - the user must authenticate using the [BrainCloudAuthentication](/api/capi/authentication "BrainCloudAuthentication") AuthenticateEmailPassword API.
- Email verification - the user is sent an email to verify that they own the account (although this does not prevent you from playing the game)
- Player Name - the user's name is stored using the [BrainCloudPlayerState](/api/capi/playerstate "BrainCloudPlayerState") UpdatePlayerName API.
- Player Statistics - the user's wins/losses are tracked using the [BrainCloudPlayerStatistics](/api/capi/playerstats "BrainCloudPlayerStatistics") APIs.
- Player Currency - the user's balance is tracked using the [BrainCloudProduct](/api/capi/product "BrainCloudProduct") currency APIs.
- Global Leaderboards - a list of the top Acey Deucey players using the [BrainCloudLeaderboard](/api/capi/leaderboard "BrainCloudSocialLeaderboard") APIs.

All of the code that interacts with the brainCloud js library is located in cardGame.js.

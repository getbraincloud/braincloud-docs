Steam does not offer native support for the Unity Game Engine. A third party git library was used to integrate Steam features into Unity.  

# Required Materials

Download Steamworks SDK from Steam

[https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk)

Steamworks.Net version 12.0.0 was used.  
[https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET/releases](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET/releases)

brainCloud version 3.11 was used.  
[https://github.com/getbraincloud/braincloud-csharp](https://github.com/getbraincloud/braincloud-csharp)

Unity 2018.2.5f1 was used

# Configure Steam Platform with brainCloud Design Portal

Enter in the Steam App Id and Steam Publisher Key into the brainCloud Design Portal via **Design -> Core App Info -> Application IDs.**  

**Steam App Id** - Retrievable via Steam’s partner network.

**Steam Publisher Key** - Also referred to as WEB API key within Steam.  From the Steam partner network, Users & Permissions.  Select the correct group, and select “Create WepAPI Key” from the right panel.  

# Configure Steamworks.Net

Update **Plugins\Steamworks.NET\redist\steam_appid.txt** with the appropriate steam app Id.  

Update **SteamManager.cs**,  
```js
if (SteamAPI.RestartAppIfNecessary(AppId_t.Invalid))
```
To
```js
if (SteamAPI.RestartAppIfNecessary((AppId_t)<yoursteamappid>) 
```
# Setup Steamworks.Net
```js
using Steamworks;

public void SetupSteamManager()
{
    if (SteamManager.Initialized)
    {
        m_bSteamInitialized = true;
        // required callback for authenticating, view Steamworks.Net + brainCloud Authentication
        m_getAuthSessionTicketResponse = Callback<GetAuthSessionTicketResponse_t>.Create(OnGetAuthSessionTicketResponse);
        // required callback for In-App Purchases, Steamworks.Net + brainCloud Microtransactions
        m_transactionCallback = Callback<MicroTxnAuthorizationResponse_t>.Create(OnTransactionResponse);
    }        
}
```
# Steamworks.Net + brainCloud Authentication
```js
using BrainCloud;

    }

    if (pCallback.m_hAuthTicket != HAuthTicket.Invalid && m_ticketSize != 0)
    {
        m_steamIdStr = steamId.ToString();
        // IMPORTANT!!! CONVERT TO HEX STRING
        m_authToken = BitConverter.ToString(m_ticket, 0, (int)m_ticketSize).Replace("-", string.Empty);

        if (!m_bAttachSteam)
        {
           BCWrapper.AuthenticateSteam(m_steamIdStr, m_authToken, false, m_steamAuthSuccess, m_steamFailure, m_steamObj);
        }
        else
        {

        }
    }

# More Info

- Often times the Steam Overlay does not render/show up during editor or developer standalone builds.  You will need to upload a build using the steam SDK content uploader, to ensure the overlay is properly rendered over Unity’s engine.  
      
    
- All Steam purchases by default are in sandbox mode, to help initial integration and testing, prior to release.  Visit the brainCloud design portal Navigate to **Design -> Core App Info -> Advanced Settings**.  At the bottom is a check mark to distinguish if Steam Store purchases should be in sandbox mode or not.  Ensure this is unselected before going to the marketplace.

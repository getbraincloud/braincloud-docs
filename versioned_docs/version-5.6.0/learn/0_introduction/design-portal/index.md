The brainCloud Design Portal is 4 powerful tools in one:

1. **Design Tool** – it’s a design tool that allows you to create, configure and define your applications.
2. **API Explorer** – it includes an expansive API Explorer that allows you to query your configured application dynamically without writing code!  Super handy for debugging and exploring the brainCloud API
3. **Monitoring Tool** – the monitoring features provide easy debugging of global and user data – and are also very useful in supporting your app once it goes live.
4. **Reporting** – brainCloud’s reporting features provide cross-platform analytics, as well as an API usage report that is useful for understanding the usage and performance of your application.

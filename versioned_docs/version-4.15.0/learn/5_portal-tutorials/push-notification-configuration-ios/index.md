This article will walk you through the steps of setting up push notifications (iOS) with brainCloud.

#### **Prerequisites**

- You have an Apple developer account
- You have a physical iOS 10 and above testing device

#### **Step 1: Create an application on Unity editor**

- Open Unity hub and create a new project.
- Download and import the latest [brainCloud client Unity package](https://github.com/getbraincloud/braincloud-csharp/releases) to this project. Once imported the plugin correctly, you will find the brainCloud tab appears on the editor menu.

- Functions and its code that linked behind the button [Register device token] are similar to below. Once authenticate end-user with their brainCloud account, from the Authorization request, retrieve the device token and pass it to brainCloud device token register method -- `RegisterPushNotificationDeviceToken`()
```js
    IEnumerator RequestAuthorization()  
    {  
        var authorizationOption = AuthorizationOption.Alert | AuthorizationOption.Badge;  
        using (var req = new AuthorizationRequest(authorizationOption, true))  
        {  
            while (!req.IsFinished)  
            {  
                yield return null;  
            };  
            string res = "\n RequestAuthorization:";  
            res += "\n finished: " + req.IsFinished;  
            res += "\n granted:  " + req.Granted;  
            res += "\n error:  " + req.Error;  
            res += "\n deviceToken:  " + req.DeviceToken;  
            Debug.Log("debug inside ienumerator the res: "+ res);  
            _bc.PushNotificationService.RegisterPushNotificationDeviceToken(req.DeviceToken, authSuccess_BCcall, authError_BCcall);  
        }  
    }  
  
    //click register token button  
    public void RegisterDeviceToken()
  
    {
  
        StartCoroutine(RequestAuthorization());  
    }
```
- Finish the rest methods and callbacks code in your script.
- Click `Build Settings` from Unity `File` tab, switch platform to iOS.

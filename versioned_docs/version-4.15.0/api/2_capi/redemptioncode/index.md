# Redemption Code
## Overview



A redemption code is a special code associated with a product that gives the user that redeems it additional benefits within the product.  Codes may be digital-only, or printed upon physical cards and sold separately at retail.

<%= data.branding.productName %>'s Redemption Code feature supports the management and implementation of single-use redemption codes.

At any time, a redemption code is in one of four states:

State | Description
--------- | -----------
Inactive | The code has been datafilled in the system, but is not ready to be redeemed. This is useful for retail cards that must be "activated" upon purchase, before they will be ready to be redeemed.  [i.e. prevents theft]
Available | A code datafilled into the system, and ready to be redeemed
InProgress | An asynchronous type code is being asynchronously redeemed and within the allowed processing time
Redeemed | A code that has already been redeemed. It will contain information about the user that redeemed it.
Invalid | A code that has been invalidated for some reason. [i.e. if a set of retail cards have been stolen, it would make sense for the retailer to invalidate those cards]

There are currently two ways to add to the redemption code inventory:

1. Call the [<code>AddCode</code>](/api/s2s/redemptioncode/addcode) method on the <%= data.branding.productName %> Server-to-Server interface. The API allows you to add a single code at a time.
2. Bulk upload a RedemptionCode inventory file.  Bulk uploads are not yet automated via the portal, so it is done via a support request. (Via the support messaging system).  Please allow minimum 48 hours notice for any upload requests.

Once the inventory is in place, the following operations are available from the client API:

* <code>[RetrieveRedeemedCodes](/api/capi/redemptioncode/getredeemedcodes)</code> – returns a list of codes that have already been redeemed by this user.
* <code>[RedeemCode](/api/capi/redemptioncode/redeemcode)</code> – redeem a code

Two additional methods are available via the Server-to-Server API:

- `ActivateCode( <scanCode>, <codeType>, <customCodeInfo> )` – activate a inactive code (i.e. make it available for redemption)
- `InvalidateCode ( <scanCode>, <codeType>, <invalidationReason> )` – invalidate a lost or stole (or otherwise fraudulent) code

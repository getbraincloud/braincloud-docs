Use the following steps to setup a Marmalade project with brainCloud.

- Create or open your Marmalade C++ project
- Download the brainCloud Marmalade C++ SDK from the Client Libs section of the brainCloud portal
- Unzip the SDK into your project folder. This should create a folder called "brainCloud" in your project folder.
- Open your project MKB file and add "braincloud" as a subproject
- In the Marmalade HUB, click the "Update from MKB" button.

Done!

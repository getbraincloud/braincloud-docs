# Push Notification
## Overview



The Push Notification service handles registering device tokens from a user's device and sending push notifications to users.

You will need to correctly configure your push notification settings from the
[Notification Settings page](https://portal.braincloudservers.com/admin/dashboard#/development/pushnotifications) of the <%= data.branding.productName %> portal before being able to send notifications.

Templated or normalized push notifications (pre-defined messages with substitutions and possibly localized versions) are configured on
the [Notification Templates](https://portal.braincloudservers.com/admin/dashboard#/development/notifications) page of the <%= data.branding.productName %> portal.

It is possible to send a push notification to oneself.

# Profanity
## Overview



<%= data.branding.productName %>â€™s Profanity Filter API allows apps to validate the contents of user-supplied data. The APIs may be called client-side or from Cloud Code.

The Profanity Filter API is an abstract API that is implemented via integration with an external provider. This API is currently supported by the **WebPurify Integration**, which requires a separate [WebPurify](http://www.webpurify.com) account, and can be configured via the
[Manage Integrations page](https://portal.braincloudservers.com/admin/dashboard#/development/integrations-manage-integrations) of the <%= data.branding.productName %> portal.

*Pro-tip: Profanity filtering can be added post-release (without client changes) to an app via the pre- API Hooks feature of <%= data.branding.productName %>.*

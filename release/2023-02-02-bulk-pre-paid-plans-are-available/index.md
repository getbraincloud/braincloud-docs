Hi folks,

The new Bulk+ Pre-paid plans are now live!

![](images/2023-02-02_08-29-50-1024x715.png)

These plans offer additional discounts for high-volume (i.e. 100M+ API / month) brainCloud apps.

The savings come primarily from pre-paying for a bulk quantity of _API Counts_ - but there are also additional savings in the pricing for _File Transfers_, _Deep Data Storage_, and _Dormant Accounts_.

Note - you can see the fine details of these plans on our shiny new [getbraincloud.com](https://getbraincloud.com) site! Just go to the Pricing tab, then choose [\[Bulk+ Plans\]](https://getbraincloud.com/pricing).

Important - These are **pre-paid** plans, the base cost of the plan will be charged to your credit card **immediately**. If you swap plans part-way through the month, the cost is pro-rated according to how many days are left in the current month.

We're pleased to announce the availability of **brainCloud 1.8** - and along with that announce that from here on out we'll be updating brainCloud every two weeks!

New features in this release include:

API Features:

- Misc fixes and improvements

Portal Features:

- **Online Support** - we've integrated with intercom.io to give you the best support experience possible. If you need assistance, just click on the green \[?\] in the bottom-right-hand corner of the screen, and we'll help!  Note - you can also e-mail **support@18.220.113.13**.
- **Product + Pricing revamp** - we've totally re-designed our product and pricing management system to make it easier to use (and to pave the way for more powerful features coming soon!)
- **Forgot Password support** - now if you forget your brainCloud password, you won't need another administrator to reset it for you!
- **New leaderboard configuration screen** - better, more intuitive layout!

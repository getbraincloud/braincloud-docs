brainCloud is free during development. While in development, apps have the following restrictions:

- 100 users per day
- 1000 users lifetime
- no live in-app purchases.

Publishing your app and associating it with a brainCloud Subscription Plan removes those limitations.

To enroll in a Subscription Plan, you'll need to create a billing account, and set up a credit card for payment.

## Creating your billing account

brainCloud uses a secure, 3rd party billing system to maintain your payment info and handle monthly invoicing.

To create your billing account:

- Select the **Team** tab from the top menu
- Select **Manage** from the side menu to view the management page choices
- Select the **Team Info** page
- Go to the _Billing Information_ section at the bottom of the page, and click the **\[Edit Billing\]** button
- _An e-mail will be sent to you_, with a link to click to create your billing account.  _Click the link._
- _Follow the instructions_ to create a billing account userid and password  
    (Note - this is separate from the brainCloud portal account, and keeps your credit card information private)
- Enter your contact info on the **\[Customer Information\]** tab
- Enter your payment info on the **\[Payment Method\]** tab

When you're done entering the information in the billing portal:

- Return to the brainCloud portal, returning to the **Team | Manage  |** **Team Info** page
- Review your _Account Status_ displayed at the bottom of the page under _Billing Info_
- This section should say "Ready to go live".  
- If it doesn't, hit the **\[Refresh Billing\]** button to update it

You're now all set to publish your app.

## Publish Your App

Once your billing info is set up, publishing an app is very straightforward.

To publish your app:

- Select the **Team** tab from the top menu
- Select **Manage** from the side menu to view the management page choices
- Select the **Apps** page
- Find the app in the list, and click the **\[Go Live!\]** button
- You'll be asked to choose the Subscription Plan to associate with your app.
- Plans have two types: **Basic** and **Plus**. _The key benefits of_ **_Plus_** _plans are support for_ **_RTT_** _and_ **_Hosting_**_, which are typically needed in head-to-head real-time games._
- Within Basic and Plus plans, you can select **Lite**, **Standard** or **Business** tiers. _Note that in addition to a higher API count, the Business Plan offers additional enterprise and integration features, plus higher base API and storage/download amounts. For full details, see_ [_this page_](http://getbraincloud.com/pricing-overview/)_.)_
- Select your preferred plan from the list, and click **\[Choose Plan\]**.

The Apps page should refresh to reflect the updated status of your app.  If it doesn't, choose **Refresh** from the Action menu.

Your app is now live - your first monthly payment will be processed at the end of the month. Note that the flat fee associated with your subscription plan (i.e. the $30 flat fee associated with the Standard plan) will be pro-rated according to how many days are left in the month.

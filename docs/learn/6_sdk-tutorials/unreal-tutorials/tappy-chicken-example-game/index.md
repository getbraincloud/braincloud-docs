For this example, we've taken Epic's Tappy Chicken example project and integrated brainCloud in place of the existing platform specific online features (Google Play / Game Center). This demonstrates how brainCloud can be easily integrated into existing projects, and acts as a detailed example of how the brainCloud Blueprint system works.

**Description from Epic:** _Tappy to flappy! Avoid the posts to collect your eggs. Epic’s app for the flap showcases the ease of use and flexibility of Unreal Engine 4. Built by a single artist with no traditional programming skills, Tappy Chicken is a lightweight app with support for Game Center leaderboards, achievements, and the iAd Network._

### brainCloud Features

- Email Authentication - Allows players to log in on any device and retrieve their progress
- Achievements - All the existing Game Center / Google Play achievements configured in brainCloud for full cross-platform support
- Leaderboards - Cross platform high score leaderboard
- User Entities - Saves the player's egg collection progress to the cloud
